/*
 For _IO,_IOR,_IOW,_IORW ref. Documentation/ioctl/ioctl-number.txt
 _IO   - implementation has neither copy_from nor copy_to user (or equivalents)
 _IOR  - implementation has copy_to_user   (or equiv., at end)
 _IOW  - implementation has copy_from_user (or equiv., at beginnning)
 _IOWR - implementaions has both copy_from_user (at beginnning) and
         copy_to_user (at end) 
NOTE: for _IOR, _IOW: the size is only for the data at the address used in the
      ioctl call; NOT for the size at an address contained within the data
      pointed to by the address used in the ioctl call.  So, if a small
      structure is pointed to (to be copied in) which has an address of a
      large buffer, the only thing that these macros should consider is the
      pointer used (directly) in the ioctl call.
